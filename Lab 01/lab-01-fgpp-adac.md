Lab 01 ‚Äì Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP) using ADAC

Objective

To apply different password policies to specific groups or users using Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC) and verify their effect with PowerShell.
So I had to create dummy users and O/Us for this specific purpose.

Lab Setup
- Domain Functional Level: Windows Server 2019
- Tools Required:
  - Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC) (GUI). N.b It can be done in powershell too.
  - PowerShell
- Account: Administrator

 Theory

Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) controls domain-level password policy, but it cannot target specific users or groups. So the general policy that had been created in a different lab(will do a breakdown soon)
It will apply to the entire domain. To be more specific to various O/Us we create groups, add members and apply FGPP.
To achieve granular password enforcement, you must use Fine-Grained Password Policies (FGPP), stored in the Password Settings Container within ADAC.
FGPPs override the domain password policy but only apply to direct users or group memberships (not OUs).
